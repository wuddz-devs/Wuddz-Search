## Installing Wuddz-Search
- Install python  [Link: https://www.python.org/downloads/]

- Install 7zip  [Link: https://www.7-zip.org/download.html]

- Add Installed 7zip Executable Folder To System Path On Windows OS

- Open "cmd" | "powershell" | "terminal" depending on your OS platform, navigate to repository root folder with setup.py file

- Type "python setup.py install"

  On linux systems python typically installs to ".local/bin/" directory, which may not be added to your system's 'PATH',
  So you may get an error when running "wudz-spa' from the terminal saying it cannot be found,
  Just add ".local/bin/" directory to "PATH" using below commands:
  "locate /.local/bin | head -n 1"           [use output folder path in below command e.g on kali linux it's /home/kali/.local/bin/]
  export PATH=$PATH:/home/kali/.local/bin/   [replace with the output folder path from above command of course]
  Run "wudz-spa" again and it should be good to go.

- Once installed just type wudz-spa in cmd|powershell|terminal and follow on screen instructions to enjoy this awesome ALL IN 1 SEARCHER, PARSER & ARCHIVER.
